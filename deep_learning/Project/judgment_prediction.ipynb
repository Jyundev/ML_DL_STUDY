St. Amant and Second party is Herman A. Thompson. On June 27, 1962, Phil St. Amant, a candidate for public office, made a television speech in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  During this speech, St. Amant accused his political opponent of being a Communist and of being involved in criminal activities with the head of the local Teamsters Union.  Finally, St. Amant implicated Herman Thompson, an East Baton Rouge deputy sheriff, in a scheme to move money between the Teamsters Union and St. Amant’s political opponent. \\nThompson successfully sued St. Amant for defamation.  Louisiana’s First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Thompson did not show St. Amant acted with “malice.”  Thompson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  That court held that, although public figures forfeit some of their First Amendment protection from defamation, St. Amant accused Thompson of a crime with utter disregard of whether the remarks were true.  Finally, that court held that the First Amendment protects uninhibited, robust debate, rather than an open season to shoot down the good name of anyone who happens to be a public servant. \\n [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] First party is Stephen Duncan and Second party is Lawrence Owens. Ramon Nelson was riding his bike when he suffered a lethal blow to the back of his head with a baseball bat. After two eyewitnesses identified Lawrence Owens from an array of photos and then a lineup, he was tried and convicted for Nelson’s death. Because Nelson was carrying cocaine and crack cocaine potentially for distribution, the judge at Owens’ bench trial ruled that Owens was probably also a drug dealer and was trying to “knock [Nelson] off.” Owens was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\\nOwens filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that his constitutional right to due process was violated during the trial. He argued that the eyewitness identification should have been inadmissible based on unreliability and that the judge impermissibly inferred a motive when a motive was not an element of the offense. The district court denied the writ of habeas corpus, and Owens appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the denial and held that the trial judge’s inference about Owens’s motive violated his right to have his guilt adjudicated solely based on the evidence presented at trial.\\n [SEP]']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["bert_sentences = [\"[CLS] \" + str(s) + \" [SEP]\" for s in train.party_info_facts]\n","bert_sentences[:2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688331260210,"user":{"displayName":"Yunyoung Jang","userId":"03748636018068817510"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"7gS9gFHs5WPV","outputId":"7917585b-f0d5-4e8a-8fc2-ad14dc4825bb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([1, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}],"source":["# 0'과 '1'의 재판 결과 라벨 컬럼 저장\n","\n","labels = train['first_party_winner'].values\n","labels\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G69_g0L04yNZ"},"source":["#### Tokenization\n","\n","- original word가 subword로 쪼개짐\n","\n","- \"##ant\"는 어떤 단어의 일부, subword라는 뜻. 독립적인 단어 \"ant\"랑 다르다는 것을 보여주기 위해\n","\n","- 전체 단어가 BERT vocab에 없으면 subword로 쪼갠다.\n","\n","- 'OOV' : Out Of Vocabulary\n","\n","- 'UNK' : UNKnown\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7256,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688331270869,"user":{"displayName":"Yunyoung Jang","userId":"03748636018068817510"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"o-DTvYFI4Gpw","outputId":"f1850390-c335-449c-93f2-a290210713f6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[CLS] First party is Phil A. St. Amant and Second party is Herman A. Thompson. On June 27, 1962, Phil St. Amant, a candidate for public office, made a television speech in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  During this speech, St. Amant accused his political opponent of being a Communist and of being involved in criminal activities with the head of the local Teamsters Union.  Finally, St. Amant implicated Herman Thompson, an East Baton Rouge deputy sheriff, in a scheme to move money between the Teamsters Union and St. Amant’s political opponent. \n","Thompson successfully sued St. Amant for defamation.  Louisiana’s First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Thompson did not show St. Amant acted with “malice.”  Thompson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  That court held that, although public figures forfeit some of their First Amendment protection from defamation, St. Amant accused Thompson of a crime with utter disregard of whether the remarks were true.  Finally, that court held that the First Amendment protects uninhibited, robust debate, rather than an open season to shoot down the good name of anyone who happens to be a public servant. \n","
